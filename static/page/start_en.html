            <p class="p">The first stage of the main network has been running stably, and currently supports bookkeeping mining, diamond mining, and diamond and currency transfer transactions. You can use a desktop computer, a dual-socket server or a cloud host to run the Hacash node, and related tools and services are under development.</p>
            <p class="p">You can use online wallets or command-line wallets to complete operations such as account creation, balance checking, transfer, sending transactions, transferring diamonds, and checking transaction status.</p>

            <p class="p">The X16RS mining algorithm invented by Hacash randomly uses 16 hash algorithms of the sha3 series, which can resist the emergence of ASIC mining machines. At present, the best solution is to use computer CPU for bookkeeping and mining.

            <p class="p">The <span class="val">hacash.config.ini</span> file in the compressed package is a necessary configuration file for the Hacash full node program.

The same is true for other configurations, such as diamond mining configuration), The <span class="val">supervene</span> parameter indicates how many threads are enabled for mining at the same time. Generally, it is consistent with the number of CPU cores of your computer, which can maximize the computing power. For example, if the number of CPU cores in your computer is 2 cores, change <span class="val">supervene: 8</span> to <span class="val">supervene: 2</span>, if it is 4 cores, change to <span class="val">supervene: 4</span>, and so on. At this time, the computer CPU utilization rate is 100%. In order to avoid computer freezing, it is generally recommended to set aside a core for other calculations: 4 cores are set to 3, and 8 cores are set to 7. You can also set it freely according to your situation. The smaller the value, the lower the CPU utilization. This value does not support decimals, the minimum is 1, and it is not recommended to set it to a value larger than the number of computer CPU cores.</p>

            <p class="p">The string value of the <span class="val">rewards</span> parameter is the Hacash account address, which is used to collect currency rewards generated by mining. This address must be generated by a password and has a specific format. It is invalid to modify the patched address manually! You can use an <a class="button olwlt" href="https://wallet.hacash.org" target="_blank">online wallet</a> to generate an account address using a password that only you know, strictly confidential and backed up, or a randomly created private key.</p>

            <p class="p notice">Notice! If you do not understand the format requirements of the <span class="val">.ini</span> configuration file, please do not arbitrarily change the field format, indentation, newline, space, etc. in the configuration file, the program will not be able to read the correct configuration information due to the format error, which will cause the running failure.</p>

            <p class="p">The above-mentioned full node mining needs to synchronize all block data, and has high requirements for the stability of the network environment (otherwise, it is easy to break the network and branch). If you do not have a more professional hardware environment and network operation and maintenance knowledge, or do not have a strong CPU performance computing machine, using the full node mining method will encounter some unnecessary trouble, or it is difficult to get the mining out.</p>
            <p class="p">We suggest that small-scale mining participants join the mining pool, so as to avoid a lot of trouble in data and network operation and maintenance.

            <p class="p">Technically speaking, the mining pool is a mining node, but the mining operation is assigned to many other computing machines, and they communicate with each other through network connection. In other words, a pool is a full node whose functions are divided into different machines for execution.</p>
            <p class="p">Building a mine pool is also very simple. First of all, you need to prepare a server with an external fixed IP address (the configuration depends on the size of the business), then <a class="dld" href="#minernode">build a mining full node</a> according to the above method, and wait for all block data to be synchronized.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="p">Configuration <span class="val">supervene</span> is the number of concurrent threads for multi-threaded parallel mining, which has the same meaning as the supervene parameter for HAC coin mining; <span class="val" The >fee_amount</span> parameter is the default fee bid amount set for the mined diamonds. If multiple diamonds are mined in a block at the same time, the diamond with the highest fee price will be packaged into the block and the whole network If the confirmation is valid, other diamonds in the same period will be considered invalid and discarded. Everyone starts to mine the next diamond from the beginning; <span class="val">fee_password</span> is the password of the account address that paid the fee for bidding Or private key (must ensure that the account has the balance set by fee_amount, so that the mined diamonds can be packaged into effect); the address set by the <span class="val">rewards</span> parameter is the reward address after the diamond is mined. That is, the attribution address of the newly mined diamond. <span class="val">continued</span> means whether to mined a diamond after mined out a diamond. This will lead to the possibility of mined out more than one diamond in a cycle. You can choose the diamond you think is more valuable to make a higher bid.</p>

            <p class="p">Through the <a class="dld" target="_blank" href="https://explorer.hacash.org/">block explorer</a> you can view the current cycle in real time The bidding ranking of all the diamonds unearthed. [Note: In a period (5 blocks), only the only diamond ranked first in the handling fee will be packaged, and other diamonds will be directly discarded]. If you need to increase the ranking to the first place, you can reset the corresponding in <a class="dld" target="_blank" href="https://wallet.hacash.org/">online wallet</a> Diamond handling fee. (The result of diamond mining is that a special transaction is packed into a block height that can be divisible by 5. The transaction fee for ranking after diamond mining is the transaction fee)</p>

            <p class="p">After starting the process of mining diamonds, the prints should be as follows:</p>

            </p>

            <p class="p">By setting the parameter of <span class="val">autobid = true</span>, the program of digging out diamonds can be bid automatically. Among them, <span class="val">fee_ amount = ㄜ1:247</span> means the first bid for digging out diamonds. Then, every 10 seconds, the program automatically checks the diamond bid of the current highest bid. If the bid is higher than my bid, the parameter autobid will be used <span class="val">autobid_fee_margin = ㄜ 2:247</span> is the step value of bid, and the price higher than the highest diamond bid will be automatically issued, so as to keep the highest bid of diamond excavated by oneself. Parameter <span class="val">autobid_fee_max = ㄜ 10:248</span> is the upper limit that I will issue for each diamond, which means that if other people bid more than this price, I will stop bidding and will not quote a higher price.</p>

            <p class="p">[special attention] automatic bidding does not guarantee that you will get diamonds. For example, the following situations occur: 1. Diamonds are mined out late at the end of the cycle, and other diamonds with the highest current price have already been packed into the block before the first bid; 2. The diamonds of others are packed just in the interval of 10 seconds' automatic bid; 3 Network synchronization is stuck and your program doesn't get other people's bid. If you want to get the diamond as much as possible, please try to optimize the following contents: 1. Upgrade to a more stable network (with better links but not more bandwidth); 2. Issue higher initial bid and bidding step value as much as possible, so as to surpass the highest bidding value set by others after a few automatic bidding, so as to defeat others. 3.Please do not set too small step value of bid (autobid_fee_margin), If the bid change is too small, it will be lower than the accuracy that can be recognized by the system, so you can't change your bidding order.</p>
