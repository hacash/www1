Technologically, Hacash upholds Bitcoin's decentralization and security while introducing diverse scalability techniques, excluding script technology to prevent network congestion caused by invalid data. It also introduces the Beacon Tower Protocol as a defense against 51% attacks.</p>

        <p class="dp">Monetarily, Hacash inherits Bitcoin's decentralized nature and widespread circulation. By facilitating one-way transfers of Bitcoin to the Hacash chain, it establishes a robust and resilient monetary system with HAC and HACD. This bridges the gap in Bitcoin's mainnet by providing monetary elasticity and addressing network security and sustainability concerns associated with its hard cap limit.</p>

Instead, it achieves long-term stability in purchasing power through market-driven mechanisms such as mining costs, collateralized loans, arbitrage, and other market forces. By operating in this manner, its goal is to maintain a relatively stable purchasing power over the long term without any systemic risks.`,
