Hacash Community
Social media, community events and offline activities



Due to the decentralized of Hacash, there is no official to establish a unified social channel, resulting in the community's platform and personnel are relatively scattered.

To this end, we launched the HacashDAO organization to gather community strength, combine various resources, and jointly promote the development of Hacash by launching crowdfunding and holding activities.

You can find social networking platforms or events on HacashDAO, as well as more useful information and materials:
