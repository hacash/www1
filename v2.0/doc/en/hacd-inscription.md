HACD Inscription
Inscriptions, art binding, and tokenization



HACD originally consisted of 6 letters, and HIP-5 gave the first visual effect of HACD. HIP-8 produces a second visual effect of HACD.


HACD already has 3 standard art forms, namely HIP-5, HIP-8 and HIP-9. Theoretically, HACD's new visuals need to meet certain conditions and criteria to guarantee the ultimate fairness of the artwork, which we call it [HIP-10 PoW Art Standard](https://github.com/hacash/paper/blob/master/HIP/diamond/PoW_Art_Standard.mediawiki) .

On top of this, and to support more flexible and richer art forms and artist engagement approaches, the community has proposed [HIP-15](https://github.com/hacash/paper/blob/master/HIP/diamond/hacd_inscription.md), the main mechanism of which is to inscribe a list of stackable, erasable inscriptions on each HACD.


Discussions about the HIP-15 proposal took place on [HacashTalk](https://hacashtalk.com/t/hip15-hacd-secondary-artistic-creation-signature-engraving-and-erasure/184) and [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/757976908653920299/802807729584209920/1189460916534771822) and culminated in an implementable execution document: [HIP-15 HACD Inscription](https://github.com/hacash/paper/blob/master/HIP/diamond/hacd_inscription.md).

### Engraved

HIP-15 will take effect from block height 518000 and will require the download of the latest offline desktop wallet to inscribe:

- [Hacash Wallet Download Center](https://github.com/hacash/wallet/releases)

After downloading, run the `hacash_desktop_offline_wallet_...` file and select the `Create/Clean HACD inscription` option:

<img class="lazy ctw" data-src="/image/tobeminer/hip15-btn.png" />

Then you come to the interface where you can create the inscription. An inscription HACD is essentially similar to initiating a transfer, both by creating a transaction and submitting it to the blockchain for confirmation. Create a HACD inscription by filling in the fields below:

<img class="lazy ctw" data-src="/image/tobeminer/hip15-crtx.png" />

After the blockchain confirms, you will see the corresponding inscription on the details page of the corresponding HACD:

<img class="lazy ctw" data-src="/image/tobeminer/hip15-show.png" />

The implementation of HIP-15 will greatly broaden the functionality and value of HACD in collectibles, art, and tokenization, and more innovations and gameplay are expected to be discovered by the community.
