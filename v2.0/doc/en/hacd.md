## Distribution Mechanism

The minted of HACD needs to be mined and bid.

The height of a block whose Hacash is divisible by 5 yields an HACD at an average interval of 25 minutes. The HACD excavated within the time of 5 blocks, the highest bid will be packaged and confirmed.

The mining difficulty of HACD is only related to the number of HACD minted, not how many people are digging at the same time. The difficulty of mining will continue to increase and will not decrease, and output can be stopped at any time according to market conditions. The difficulty of mining will slowly rise to the limit, and eventually far exceed the difficulty of mining Bitcoin.

It produces up to 58 per day and about 21,000 per year. Assuming enough computing power is invested, it is estimated that at most, less than 1.7 million HACDs will be excavated by 2100.

## How to create art at HACD

[HIP-10](https://github.com/hacash/paper/blob/master/HIP/diamond/PoW_Art_Standard.mediawiki) gives everyone a clearer standard rules for artistic creation.


## Why is HACD Valuable

- Like BTC, endogenous value is generated through PoW
- HACD are digital assets that are stores of value, and the total amount of HACD is limited, and the generation of new HACD slows down over time
- The generation of HACD requires HAC bidding with additional intrinsic value
- HACD, like NFT, can be used for investment and collection
- The six letters of HACD can be used to identify the account address of Hacash layer 2

## HACD Arts

HACD supports three levels of artistic creation, namely the protocol layer, the HIP visualization layer and the art additional layer.
