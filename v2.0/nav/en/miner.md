HAC Mining
You can build a full node mining HAC can also join the mining pool, the current CPU and GPU can be mined, but the open source full node only CPU, there are developers and companies to develop GPU.

/mining-HACD
HACD Mining
At present, HACD has no mining pool or GPU, and can only build a full node for CPU mining. After HACD is dug up, it is required to bid with other miners who dig HACD using HAC.

/mining-pool
HAC Mining Pool
You can build a HAC pool or join someone else's pool. The current mining pool has CPU and GPU, there are different allocation and charging modes, please choose your own mining pool to join.

/mining-resource

Tool Development
Thanks to the fair distribution model, HAC and HACD mining is still in its early stages, which means there are plenty of opportunities for you to explore and create.
